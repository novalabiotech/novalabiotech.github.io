Getting married is a life-changing experience—and for many couples in Nepal and around the world, the next big step is starting a family. But did you know that proper planning can increase your chances of a healthy and successful pregnancy?

Whether you're ready now or planning for the near future, this blog is your go-to guide for understanding the best time, tools, and lifestyle changes needed for conception. Let's explore what science and tradition say about planning for a baby.

## 👶 Why Planning Matters for Parenthood

Having a baby is more than just timing—it’s about being emotionally, physically, and financially ready. Planning pregnancy can:

* Increase chances of natural conception
* Reduce health risks for mother and baby
* Help identify and address fertility issues early
* Support emotional and mental readiness

## 📅 Step 1: Understand Your Fertility Cycle

One of the most important things a woman can do is track her ovulation. Ovulation is when an egg is released from the ovary-your most fertile period.

#### ✅ How to Track Ovulation:

* Use Ovulation Test Kits like Ovasure, available in Nepal, to detect the LH surge
* Use mobile fertility apps
* Monitor cervical mucus and basal body temperature

Pro Tip: Most women ovulate about 14 days before their next period. Timing intercourse around this window increases your chances.

## 🧪 Step 2: Use Ovulation Kits for Better Accuracy

Ovulation kits, like Novala Biotech’s Ovasure, help detect the Luteinizing Hormone (LH) surge that occurs before ovulation.

#### Benefits:

* Over 97% accuracy in detecting LH surge (Ref: American Pregnancy Association)
* Non-invasive, simple to use at home
* Empowers couples to time intercourse more effectively

## 🥗 Step 3: Adopt a Fertility-Friendly Lifestyle

A healthy lifestyle can enhance fertility for both men and women. Make these changes early:

* Eat a balanced diet rich in folic acid, iron, and antioxidants
* Exercise regularly, but avoid overtraining
* Stop smoking and limit alcohol
* Manage stress through yoga, meditation, or hobbies
* Maintain a healthy weight

According to the WHO, underweight or overweight women may face ovulation problems. (Ref: [WHO Fertility Guidelines](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/infertility))

## 🧑‍⚕️ Step 4: Get Preconception Check-Ups

Visit a gynaecologist or family physician to:

* Review medical history
* Get vaccinated (rubella, hepatitis, etc.)
* Screen for reproductive issues
* Discuss any family genetic conditions

Early health checks can help avoid complications later and prepare your body for pregnancy.

## 🧬 Step 5: Try Naturally for 6–12 Months

* Couples under 35 should try naturally for up to 12 months
* Over 35? Consult a fertility specialist if you're not pregnant within 6 months

Regular intercourse (every 2–3 days) around ovulation is key. Use ovulation kits to time it right.

## 💉 Step 6: Know When to Seek Medical Help

If you’ve been trying but haven’t conceived:

* Male fertility test for sperm quality and needed lifestyle modifications
* Start with ovulation induction (with pills)
* Move to IUI (Intrauterine Insemination) if needed
* Consider IVF or ICSI for complex cases

Talk to a fertility expert for guidance. Many couples conceive with minimal intervention when they act early.

## 🛍️ Bonus: Must-Have Tools for Your Baby Journey

* ✅ Ovasure Ovulation Kit – Easy, affordable, accurate, and made in Nepal
* ✅ Folic Acid supplements – Start at least 1 month before conception
* ✅ Digital calendar or fertility tracker app like flo, period calender, clue

Pregnancy doesn’t always happen instantly—and that’s okay. With smart planning, the right tools like ovulation kits, and a healthy mindset, you can increase your chances of a smooth and joyful pregnancy journey.
