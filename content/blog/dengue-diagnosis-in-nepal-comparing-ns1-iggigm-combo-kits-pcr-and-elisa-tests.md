Dengue fever remains a major health threat, particularly during the monsoon season in countries like Nepal.
Early and accurate diagnosis plays a critical role in saving lives and preventing outbreaks from worsening.
But with multiple diagnostic options available — including Dengue NS1 Rapid Test, IgG/IgM antibody tests, NS1 + IgG/IgM combo kits, PCR, and ELISA-based NS1 assays — how should healthcare providers choose?

Let’s break down and compare each method across important factors like time to diagnosis, cost, practicality, and healthcare efficiency.

### 1\. Dengue NS1 Antigen Rapid Test Kits

What it Detects:

* NS1 protein antigen (secreted by the dengue virus during the early infection phase)

Best Use Window:

* Day 1 to Day 5 of fever

Features:

* Results in 15–20 minutes.
* High specificity and sensitivity during the early stage.
* Minimal training needed.
* Works well even in rural or outreach settings.
* Can be used with just Serum or plasma or Whole blood with buffer

Healthcare Efficiency:

* Excellent for emergency diagnosis, pharmacies,clinics, basic labs, primary care centers, mobile health camps.
* This kit is best for initial days of dengue fever

Cost:

* Affordable (\~ NPR 400-600/test depending on volume and brand) Only few best brands including Novala products are available.

Limitations:

* Slightly lower sensitivity if tested after Day 5 of illness.
* Cannot detect previous dengue infections or immunity.

### 2\. Dengue IgG/IgM Antibody Rapid Test Kits

What it Detects:

* IgM antibodies (appear \~5 days after infection)
* IgG antibodies (indicate past infection or secondary dengue infection)

Best Use Window:

* From Day 5 onwards of fever

Features:

* Quick results (\~15–20 minutes).
* Useful for distinguishing primary vs secondary infections.

Healthcare Efficiency:

* Good tool in later stages or when NS1 antigen levels have dropped.
* Valuable for epidemiological surveillance.

Cost:

* Affordable (\~ NPR 400-600/test)

Limitations:

* Poor early-stage diagnosis.
* Possibility of cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses (e.g., Zika, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile).

### 3\. Dengue NS1 + IgG/IgM Combo Rapid Test Kits

What it Detects:

* NS1 antigen + IgG + IgM antibodies in one device.

Best Use Window:

* Day 1 to beyond Day 7 of infection.

Features:

* Combines benefits of NS1 antigen and antibody detection.
* Covers both early and late phases of infection.
* Single sample, single test format.

Healthcare Efficiency:

* Highly efficient for clinics and hospitals that want one solution.
* Reduces need for repeat testing.

Cost:

* Slightly higher than individual tests (\~ NPR 800-1200/test).

Limitations:

* Slightly more complex interpretation.
* Requires good storage conditions to maintain accuracy.

### 4\. PCR Testing (Polymerase Chain Reaction)

What it Detects:

* Dengue viral RNA (molecular detection)

Best Use Window:

* First 5–7 days of infection

Features:

* Highly sensitive and specific.
* Can identify serotype of dengue virus (DENV-1 to DENV-4).

Healthcare Efficiency:

* Excellent for research centers, reference labs, and severe cases.
* Not practical for frontline or rural clinics.

Cost:

* Expensive (\~ NPR 5000–12000/test depending on the setup).

Limitations:

* Requires a fully equipped molecular lab.
* Trained personnel needed.
* Longer turnaround time (few hours to 1–2 days).

### 5\. ELISA-based NS1 Antigen Tests

What it Detects:

* NS1 antigen (via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)

Best Use Window:

* Day 1 to Day 5 of illness

Features:

* High throughput — can process 96 samples at once.
* High sensitivity and specificity.
* Better suited for hospital labs and surveillance studies.

Healthcare Efficiency:

* Good for mass testing at central hospitals during outbreaks.
* Not ideal for immediate diagnosis at the bedside.
* Less likely to be available in Nepal

Cost:

* Moderate (\~ NPR 700–1500/sample).

Limitations:

* Needs lab infrastructure (incubators, washers, readers).
* Delayed results (\~4–6 hours).

| Test Type           | Detection Window | Time to Result   | Cost   | Infrastructure Need | Best For                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NS1 Rapid Test      | Day 1–5          | 15–20 min        | Low    | Minimal             | Early detection at pharmacy, primary health centres, bedside, clinics, camps |
| IgG/IgM Rapid Test  | After Day 5      | 15–20 min        | Low    | Minimal             | Late-stage detection                                                         |
| NS1 + IgG/IgM Combo | Day 1–7+         | 15–20 min        | Medium | Minimal             | One-step comprehensive testing                                               |
| PCR                 | Day 1–7          | Few hours–2 days | High   | Advanced lab        | Severe cases, research                                                       |
| ELISA NS1           | Day 1–5          | 4–6 hours        | Medium | Moderate lab        | Central labs, mass screening                                                 |

### Which Test Should You Choose?

* For fast, frontline diagnosis especially in clinics, camps, and small hospitals across Nepal, Dengue NS1 Rapid Test Kits are the best first choice.
* If you want to cover both early and late-stage infection in one test, the NS1 + IgG/IgM combo kit don’t give the confirmatory results..
* PCR and ELISA-based methods are ideal for hospital laboratories, research studies, or confirmatory testing — but they are impractical for immediate, broad use in many parts of Nepal.
* Cost-effectiveness, speed, and ease of use favor rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) like NS1 kits during Nepal's dengue outbreaks.

Choosing the right test improves patient care, strengthens outbreak response, and saves lives.
