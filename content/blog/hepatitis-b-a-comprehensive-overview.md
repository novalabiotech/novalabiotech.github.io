Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which can lead to both acute and chronic diseases. Affecting millions globally, HBV is a significant public health issue. Early detection is key in managing the virus and preventing long-term complications such as liver disease, cirrhosis, or even liver cancer. Rapid HBV tests, such as those produced by Novala Biotech, play a crucial role in identifying infections swiftly and enabling timely intervention. This blog will explore the nature of hepatitis B, the importance of early detection, and how HBV rapid tests work to improve patient outcomes.![](/img/hepatitis-e-thumbnail.jpg)

### Overview of Hepatitis B

Hepatitis B is a vaccine-preventable disease that primarily affects the liver. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is highly contagious and spreads through blood, semen, or other body fluids of an infected person. It is often referred to as a "silent" infection because many people may not experience noticeable symptoms. Despite the availability of vaccines, millions of individuals around the world are at risk of contracting HBV, especially in regions where the virus is more prevalent.

HBV can cause two types of infections:

1. Acute Hepatitis B: A short-term infection that occurs within the first six months of exposure. In some cases, individuals may have no symptoms, while others could experience severe illness requiring hospitalisation.
2. Chronic Hepatitis B: For some, the virus remains in the body long-term, leading to chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis B can cause serious complications such as liver damage, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.

HBV is particularly dangerous for young children and infants. Around 90% of infants infected with HBV at birth or within the first year of life develop chronic hepatitis B. Adults, however, have a better chance of recovery, with around 95% recovering completely from the acute form without becoming chronically infected.

### Importance of Early Detection

Early detection of hepatitis B is vital in preventing the progression of the disease. Without early identification and treatment, chronic hepatitis B can silently damage the liver, leading to life-threatening conditions. This makes screening and testing essential, even in the absence of symptoms.

Health organizations, including the CDC, recommend testing all adults at least once in their lifetime for hepatitis B. Early detection allows healthcare providers to:

* Initiate antiviral treatments to manage chronic infections.
* Monitor liver health and prevent complications like liver failure or cancer.
* Reduce the risk of transmission to others, especially in high-risk groups such as healthcare workers or individuals with multiple sexual partners.

Testing is also crucial for pregnant women, as it helps to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the virus. Infants born to HBV-infected mothers can be vaccinated immediately after birth, reducing the risk of chronic infection.

### How HBV Rapid Tests Function

Despite the availability of the hepatitis B vaccine in Nepal for nearly 20 years, HBV cases continue to be reported in hospitals across the country. Many people in rural areas remain unprotected, likely due to the high cost of the vaccine and its low prioritisation by government policymakers. It was observed in various research reports, higher prevalence of HBsAg among jaundice cases compared to the government's annual report, which indicated only 0.9% of the population as HBsAg positive. The seroprevalence of HBV infection is not uniform, varying across different regions and ethnic groups in Nepal.

HBV rapid tests, like the Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) rapid test can be used for best screening for Hepatitis B virus. HBsAg rapid test kits produced by Novala Biotech, offer a fast and effective way to detect HBV infection. These tests are designed for point-of-care use, allowing healthcare providers to perform them in clinics, hospitals, or even in remote areas with limited laboratory infrastructure.

The HBV rapid test works by detecting the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in blood samples. HBsAg is one of the earliest markers of HBV infection, appearing before symptoms and persisting throughout the acute phase of the disease. In individuals with chronic HBV infection, HBsAg may remain detectable for life.

Here’s a simplified breakdown of how the HBV rapid test works:

1. Sample Collection: A small sample of blood is collected from the patient, which could be whole blood, serum, or plasma.
2. Application to Test Device: The sample is applied to the test device, which contains special antibodies designed to detect HBsAg.
3. Results Display: Within 10 to 20 minutes, the test displays a result indicating whether HBsAg is present, thereby confirming a hepatitis B infection if positive.

The benefits of rapid testing include:

* Quick turnaround time: Results in under 30 minutes enable swift medical decision-making.
* Ease of use: Minimal training is required to perform the test.
* Cost-effectiveness: Affordable and accessible, making them ideal for widespread screening programs.
