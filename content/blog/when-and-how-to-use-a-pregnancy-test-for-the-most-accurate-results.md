**When and How to Use a Pregnancy Test for the Most Accurate Results**

For millions of women worldwide, pregnancy tests offer reassurance, clarity, and timely guidance when planning their reproductive journey. Whether used at home, in clinics, or at pharmacies, these tests are designed to provide quick and reliable answers—if used correctly.

This guide explains the ideal timing, testing methods, reading results, and understanding false positives and negatives—helping users obtain the most accurate outcome.

**How Pregnancy Tests Work**

Pregnancy tests detect the hormone **human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)**, produced after implantation. Most rapid tests use lateral flow technology to visually indicate the presence of hCG in urine.

**When Should You Take a Pregnancy Test?**

**1. After a Missed Period (Best Timing)**

The ideal time is **1–7 days after a missed menstrual cycle**, when hCG levels are high enough for detection.

**2. Early Testing (Before Missed Period)**

Possible with high-sensitivity tests—but may lead to false negatives.

**3. Testing After Conception or IVF**

Patients undergoing fertility treatments should follow medical guidance due to fluctuating hormone levels.

**How to Use a Pregnancy Test Correctly**

1. Check expiration date
2. Collect urine sample 
3. Use first-morning urine for highest accuracy
4. Place sample in designated area
5. Use only 3-4 drops of urine samples using the given dropper.
6. Wait for  at least 5 min for correct results but results may come within 1 minutes
7. Read test within the time window

Incorrect reading time is one of the most common causes of misinterpretation.

**Interpreting Results**

**Positive Result**

Two visible lines  means positive sign.
Even a faint line in "T" is generally considered positive.

**Negative Result**

Only the control line appears.

**Invalid Result**

Missing control line indicates the test malfunctioned.
 
**Causes of False Results**

**False Positive:**

- Recent pregnancy
- Fertility hormones
- Other Medical conditions affecting hCG

**False Negative:**

- Testing too early
- Diluted urine
- Improper testing technique
- Expired product
- Urine sample from day time.

High-quality tests reduce these issues significantly.
 
**Accuracy of Pregnancy Tests**

Most modern tests deliver **over 99% accuracy** when used correctly and at the right time. However, results vary across manufacturers—making quality assurance essential.
