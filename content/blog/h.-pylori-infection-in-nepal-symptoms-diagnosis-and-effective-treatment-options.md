Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is one of the most common causes of gastric discomfort, ulcers, and long-term gastrointestinal complications worldwide. Nepal, with its diverse population, varying sanitation conditions, and limited diagnostic access in rural areas, experiences a high prevalence of this infection.

Understanding symptoms, risk factors, diagnostic methods, and treatment pathways is essential for both patients and healthcare providers.

**What Is H. pylori?**

H. pylori is a spiral-shaped bacterium that colonizes the stomach lining. It weakens the mucosal barrier, leading to:

- Gastritis
- Peptic ulcers
- Acid reflux
- Increased risk of stomach cancer

Transmission often occurs through contaminated water, food, or close household contact.

**Common Symptoms of H. pylori Infection**

- Upper abdominal pain
- Bloating
- Nausea
- Loss of appetite
- Frequent burping
- Burning sensation
- Unexplained weight loss

However, **many people show no symptoms**, making screening crucial.

**Diagnosis of H. pylori in Nepal**

Available methods include:

**1. Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs)**

Detect H. pylori antigens or antibodies in stool or blood.
Fast, affordable, and ideal for primary care settings.

**2. Urea Breath Test**

Highly accurate but available mostly in advanced labs.

**3. Endoscopy with biopsy**

Gold standard but invasive.

**Why RDTs Are Practical in Nepal**

- Widely accessible
- No laboratory setup needed
- Results in minutes
- Suitable for rural healthcare posts

**Treatment Options**

Standard therapy includes:

**Triple Therapy:**

- Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)
- Clarithromycin
- Amoxicillin or metronidazole

**Quadruple Therapy:**

Recommended when resistance is suspected.

Patients must complete the full course to ensure eradication.

**Preventing H. pylori Infection**

- Drink clean water
- Maintain hygiene practices
- Avoid shared eating utensils
- Seek early diagnosis for gastric symptoms
