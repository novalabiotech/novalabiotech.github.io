Hepatitis E is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV). Unlike other hepatitis viruses, HEV is primarily transmitted through contaminated water and poor sanitation conditions, making it more prevalent in developing countries, including Nepal. In most cases, people recover fully from hepatitis E without long-term health issues. However, it can cause complications in certain populations, highlighting the importance of early detection.

### Understanding Hepatitis E

Hepatitis E is common in regions with inadequate sanitation, such as South Asia, Africa, and parts of Central America. The disease is rare in developed nations like the United States, where access to clean drinking water reduces the risk of infection. However, individuals who travel to areas with poor sanitation may contract the virus.

Infection typically occurs when someone ingests food or water contaminated with HEV-infected feces.

* Fatigue
* Fever
* Nausea and vomiting
* Loss of appetite
* Abdominal pain
* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)
* Dark urine or pale stools

Symptoms generally appear 2 to 6 weeks after exposure, making timely diagnosis crucial for proper care.

### At-Risk Populations for Hepatitis E

While most people recover from hepatitis E, certain populations are at higher risk for severe complications, including:

* Pregnant women, who may face life-threatening conditions
* Immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV or those who have undergone organ transplants
* Individuals with chronic liver conditions

For these vulnerable groups, early detection and management of the disease are essential to prevent liver failure or long-term liver damage.

### The Role of IgG/IgM Tests in Early Detection

Detecting hepatitis E early is critical for preventing severe outcomes, especially in high-risk populations. Hepatitis E can only be diagnosed through laboratory tests, and one of the most effective tools for early detection is the rapid IgG/IgM test.

The IgG/IgM rapid test identifies specific antibodies produced by the body in response to HEV infection. IgM antibodies are typically present during the acute phase of infection, while IgG antibodies indicate past or long-term infection. By detecting these antibodies, the rapid test provides healthcare professionals with the ability to quickly confirm whether someone is infected with the virus, allowing for timely treatment and management.

### Why Rapid Tests Are Essential in Remote Areas

In countries like Nepal, where healthcare access is limited in rural areas, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) like the IgG/IgM test for hepatitis E play a vital role. These portable and easy-to-use tests allow for quick diagnosis in remote regions, reducing the need for extensive lab facilities and enabling immediate medical response. This is especially important in regions where sanitation is poor and the risk of outbreaks is high and can be useful for those trekking and mountaineering routes  where tourism is highly prominent.

Hepatitis E remains a significant health concern in developing countries like Nepal, particularly in areas with poor sanitation. Early detection through rapid IgG/IgM testing is crucial in preventing severe complications, especially for at-risk populations like pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems. As a leading diagnostic rapid kit manufacturer, NOVALA Biotech is committed to improving healthcare accessibility by providing reliable, easy-to-use tests that support early diagnosis and better disease management.

By focusing on early detection, we can work towards reducing the burden of hepatitis E, particularly in underserved and remote areas where healthcare resources are limited.
