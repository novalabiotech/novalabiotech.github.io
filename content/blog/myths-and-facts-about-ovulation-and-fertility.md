Whether you're actively trying to conceive or just starting to learn about your reproductive health, it's easy to get lost in a sea of misinformation. From old wives’ tales to well-meaning advice, many fertility and ovulation myths continue to circulate in Nepal—causing confusion, stress, and missed opportunities.

Let’s clear the air. Here are some of the most common ovulation and fertility myths, along with the facts you need to know.

Myth 1: Ovulation Always Happens on Day 14

Fact: Ovulation does not happen on the same day for everyone. While Day 14 may be average for a 28-day cycle, many women ovulate earlier or later—especially if their cycles are irregular.

> ✅ Tip: Use an ovulation test kit to detect your unique fertile window, rather than relying on averages.

Myth 2: You Can Get Pregnant Any Day of the Month

Fact: A woman is only fertile for about 5–6 days per cycle—the day of ovulation and the days leading up to it. Outside of this window, the chances of pregnancy are low.

> 🧪 Using an ovulation kit helps you identify those few critical days and time intercourse effectively.

Myth 3: Fertility Isn’t Affected Until After Age 40

Fact: Fertility begins to gradually decline after age 30, and more significantly after 35. That doesn’t mean pregnancy is impossible, but age is an important factor in fertility planning.

> 📌 If you're over 30 and trying to conceive, track ovulation proactively and consult a fertility expert if needed.

Myth 4: Period Tracker Apps Are Enough to Predict Ovulation

Fact: While period apps can be helpful, they’re based on estimates. They can’t detect the hormonal changes that signal actual ovulation.

> 🔍 For accurate results, combine tracking apps with LH-based ovulation test kits like Ovasure by Novala Biotech.

🌡️ Myth 5: A Regular Period Means You’re Definitely Ovulating

Fact: Regular periods don’t always mean regular ovulation. You can still experience anovulatory cycles—when no egg is released—even with timely periods.

> 🧪 Testing for the LH surge confirms whether ovulation is truly occurring.

Bonus Myth: Stress Doesn’t Affect Fertility

Fact: Chronic stress can disrupt hormonal balance and delay or prevent ovulation. Emotional health is an essential part of fertility health.

✨ Practice self-care, reduce stress, and track ovulation for better results.
