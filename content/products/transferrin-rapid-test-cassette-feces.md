## **Quick Overview**

The **Transferrin Rapid Test Cassette** is a fast, reliable, lateral flow immunoassay designed for the **qualitative detection of transferrin in human feces**. It supports early detection of **gastrointestinal bleeding**, including **colorectal cancer**, delivering results in just **5 minutes**.

## **Why Choose Transferrin Rapid Test?**

- **Early Detection of GI Bleeding:** Transferrin is more stable in feces than hemoglobin, providing an accurate marker for gastrointestinal disorders.
- **Fast & Convenient:** Simple visual test with **results in 5 minutes**.
- **Professional Reliability:** Designed for use in **hospitals, clinics, and physician offices**.
- **High Accuracy:** Proven **>99% reproducibility** and **100% agreement** with commercial tests.

## **How It Works**

The test uses **immunochromatography technology**:

1. Fecal sample is applied to the cassette.
2. Transferrin binds to antibodies on the test strip.
3. **Colored line at “T”** indicates positive; **line at “C”** confirms proper testing.

**Interpretation:**

- **Positive:** Two lines (C + T) – transferrin ≥40 ng/mL.
- **Negative:** Single control line (C) – transferrin <40 ng/mL.
- **Invalid:** No control line (C) – repeat test.

## **Key Features**

- **Rapid Results:** Detect transferrin in **5 minutes**.
- **High Sensitivity:** Detects **≥40 ng/mL** transferrin.
- **No Cross-Reactivity:** Safe from interference by food, common biological substances, or animal transferrin.
- **Professional Use:** Strictly for **in vitro diagnostic applications**.

## **Usage & Sample Handling**

- Collect **1-2 g or mL of feces** in a clean container.
- Test **within 6 hours**; refrigerate (2–8°C) up to 3 days or freeze for longer storage.
- Thaw frozen samples completely before testing; avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.

**Step-by-Step:**

1. Bring test and sample to **room temperature**.
2. Apply **3 drops (≈100 μL)** of specimen to the cassette.
3. Wait **5 minutes** and read results.

## **Storage & Stability**

- Store in sealed pouch at **4°C–30°C (40°F–86°F)**.
- Use **within 1 hour** once opened.
- Avoid prolonged heat and humidity to maintain accuracy.

## **Safety & Precautions**

- For **professional use only**.
- Treat all specimens as potentially infectious.
- Wear **gloves, lab coat, and eye protection**.
- Do not use after **expiration date**.

## **Reliable Performance**

- **Sensitivity:** ≥40 ng/mL transferrin.
- **Accuracy:** 100% agreement with reference rapid tests.
- **Reproducibility:** Over 99% intra- and inter-lab agreement.
- **No Interference:** Compatible with common biological substances.

## **Applications**

- Routine **physical exams**
- Monitoring **gastrointestinal bleeding**
- Screening for **colorectal cancer**
