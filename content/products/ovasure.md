## Principle
Ovulation is the process where an egg is released from the ovary and passes into the Fallopian tube, ready for fertilization. For pregnancy to occur, sperm must fertilize the egg within 24 hours of its release. Just before ovulation, the body produces a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH), which triggers the release of the mature egg from the ovary. This "LH surge" typically happens mid-cycle and marks the most fertile period.

The Ovasure Ovulation Test detects the presence of human luteinizing hormone (LH) by visually interpreting color changes on the testing cassette. Anti-LH antibodies are immobilized in the test region of the membrane, while anti-mouse antibodies are in the control region. During the test, the specimen reacts with anti-LH antibodies attached to coloured particles on the sample pad of the strip. This mixture migrates through the membrane by capillary action and interacts with reagents on the membrane.

If the LH level in the specimen is 25 mIU/ml or higher, indicating an LH surge, a colored band will appear in the test region. If no colored band forms in the test region or if the color intensity of this band is less than that of the control line, it indicates a negative test result, meaning the LH level is below 25 mIU/ml and at a basal level.

## Product Description
Planning for a family can be an exciting yet challenging journey. Ovasure is here to help simplify the process by accurately identifying your most fertile days. This easy-to-use ovulation detection kit tracks the increase in Luteinizing Hormone (LH), which occurs just before ovulation, helping you pinpoint the best time to conceive.

Ovulation, the release of a mature egg from the ovary, typically happens 13 to 15 days before your next period. Just before this fertile window, LH levels surge, indicating your optimal time for conception. With Ovasure, you can eliminate uncertainty and enhance your chances of getting pregnant.

Ovasure is designed to support you throughout your fertility journey, offering reliable, accurate results you can trust.

## FAQs for Ovasure Ovulation Test Kit
1. How do I calculate my menstrual cycle length?
- To calculate your cycle length, start counting from the first day of your period until the day before your next period begins. For irregular cycles, track your cycle for three months and take the average.
2. Will Ovasure accurately predict my ovulation if I have PCOS/PCOD?
- Yes, Ovasure can detect ovulation even with PCOS/PCOD. However, if you get consistent negative results, you may be experiencing anovulatory cycles and should consult your gynecologist.
3. What time of the day should I carry out the test?
- Test between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. for the most accurate results. Avoid drinking large amounts of fluids two hours before testing. First morning urine is not recommended as it is concentrated and may give a false positive result.
4. Do I need to test again the next day after getting a positive result?
- No, once you get a positive result, you can stop testing. A positive result indicates your LH surge, which means ovulation is likely within the next 24-36 hours.
5. How do I use the Ovasure test kit?
- Collect urine in the provided container, use the dropper to add 3 drops to the sample well, and read the results within 5 minutes.
6. When should I start testing during my cycle?
- It depends on length of your menstrural cycle. {{< ovasure-calculator id=faq >}}. If your cycle length is less than 21 or greater than 40, consult your gynecologist.
7. What do the results mean?
- Two pink lines on C & T indicate a positive result. One line on C or a faint line on T means you need to keep testing. No lines or a single line on T indicates an invalid result, so use a new test.
8. How long should I continue testing if I keep getting negative results?
- Continue testing for up to 5 days. If you still get negative results, you may not have ovulated this cycle or may need to consult a healthcare professional.

- No, but consult your physician if you are taking any hormonal medication. Recent use of oral contraceptives, breastfeeding, or pregnancy could affect the test results.
14. Will the amount of liquid I drink affect the result?
- Heavy fluid intake before testing can dilute the LH hormone in your urine. Limit your fluid intake for about two hours before performing the test.

16. Once I see a positive result, when is the best time to have intercourse?
- Ovulation is likely to occur within 24-36 hours. This is your most fertile time. Sexual intercourse within 24-36 hours of detecting the surge is advised.
17. I am now using the basal body temperature method (BBT). Does this test replace BBT?
- Ovasure does not replace the BBT method. The BBT method indicates that ovulation has already occurred, while Ovasure indicates that ovulation is about to occur.
18. I received a positive result and had intercourse during these fertile days, but I have not become pregnant. What should I do?
- Many factors can affect your ability to become pregnant. It can take healthy couples many months to achieve pregnancy. If you do not achieve pregnancy after 3-4 months of using the test kit, consult your physician.

- You may have miscalculated your period. Repeat the test, and if you still get negative results, consult your doctor.
21. What if the LH surge is not detected?
- If you cannot detect an LH surge, it may be because you did not ovulate that month, which is normal occasionally. You might have missed the surge due to an irregular cycle or miscalculation. Continue testing with another kit or start testing earlier next month. Ensure that the urine sample was collected correctly, and if irregular results persist, consult your physician.
