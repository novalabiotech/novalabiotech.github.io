## Principle
Ovulation is the process where an egg is released from the ovary and passes into the Fallopian tube, ready for fertilization. For pregnancy to occur, sperm must fertilize the egg within 24 hours of its release. Just before ovulation, the body produces a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH), which triggers the release of the mature egg from the ovary. This "LH surge" typically happens mid-cycle and marks the most fertile period.

Ovasure detects the presence of human luteinizing hormone (LH) by visually interpreting color changes on the testing cassette. Anti-LH antibodies are immobilized in the test region of the membrane, while anti-mouse antibodies are in the control region. During the test, the specimen reacts with anti-LH antibodies attached to coloured particles on the sample pad of the strip. This mixture migrates through the membrane by capillary action and interacts with reagents on the membrane.

If the LH level in the specimen is 25 mIU/ml or higher, indicating an LH surge, a colored band will appear in the test region. If no colored band forms in the test region or if the color intensity of this band is less than that of the control line, it indicates a negative test result, meaning the LH level is below 25 mIU/ml and at a basal level.

## Product Description
Planning for a family can be an exciting yet challenging journey. Ovasure is here to help simplify the process by accurately identifying your most fertile days. This easy-to-use ovulation detection kit tracks the increase in Luteinizing Hormone (LH), which occurs just before ovulation, helping you pinpoint the best time to conceive.

Ovulation, the release of a mature egg from the ovary, typically happens 13 to 15 days before your next period. Just before this fertile window, LH levels surge, indicating your optimal time for conception. With Ovasure, you can eliminate uncertainty and enhance your chances of getting pregnant.

Ovasure is designed to support you throughout your fertility journey, offering reliable, accurate results you can trust.

  ![ovasure result](/img/products/ovasure-result.webp)
* **Positive Result**: Two pink lines appear on C & T. This indicates an LH surge, meaning ovulation is likely to occur within the next 24-36 hours.
* **Negative Result**: One line appears on C, or the line on T is very faint. Continue testing daily until you get a positive result.
* **Invalid Result**: No lines or only one line on T. Discard the test and use a new test strip.
8. After Testing:
* Dispose of the used test cassette, dropper, and urine container in the trash. Do not flush them.
* Wash your hands thoroughly after handling the test materials.
9. Repeat Testing:
* If the result is negative, continue testing for next 4 days or until you get a positive result.

## FAQs
1. How do I calculate my menstrual cycle length?
- To calculate your cycle length, start counting from the first day of your period until the day before your next period begins. For irregular cycles, track your cycle for three months and take the average.
2. Will Ovasure accurately predict my ovulation if I have PCOS/PCOD?
- Yes, Ovasure can detect ovulation even with PCOS/PCOD. However, if you get consistent negative results, you may be experiencing anovulatory cycles and should consult your gynecologist.
3. What time of the day should I carry out the test?
- Test between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. for the most accurate results. Avoid drinking large amounts of fluids two hours before testing. First morning urine is not recommended as it is concentrated and may give a false positive result.
4. Do I need to test again the next day after getting a positive result?
- No, once you get a positive result, you can stop testing. A positive result indicates your LH surge, which means ovulation is likely within the next 24-36 hours.
5. How do I use the Ovasure test kit?
- Collect urine in the provided container, use the dropper to add 3 drops to the sample well, and read the results within 5 minutes.
6. When should I start testing during my cycle?
- It depends on length of your menstrural cycle. {{< ovasure-calculator id=faq >}} If your cycle length is less than 21 or greater than 40, consult your gynecologist.
7. What do the results mean?
- Two pink lines on C & T indicate a positive result. One line on C or a faint line on T means you need to keep testing. No lines or a single line on T indicates an invalid result, so use a new test.
8. How long should I continue testing if I keep getting negative results?
- Continue testing for up to 5 days. If you still get negative results, you may not have ovulated this cycle or may need to consult a healthcare professional.
9. Can I reuse the test kit?
- No, each test kit is for single use only. Using a new test kit each time ensures accuracy.
10. Is there a specific way to store the Ovasure test kits?
- Store the test kits in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture to maintain their effectiveness.
11. Can I use Ovasure to avoid pregnancy?
- No, Ovasure should not be used as a form of birth control.
12. How accurate is Ovasure ?
- In laboratory studies, Ovasure has been proven to be over 96% accurate.
13. Do alcohol or common medications affect the test?
- No, but consult your physician if you are taking any hormonal medication. Recent use of oral contraceptives, breastfeeding, or pregnancy could affect the test results.
14. Will the amount of liquid I drink affect the result?
- Heavy fluid intake before testing can dilute the LH hormone in your urine. Limit your fluid intake for about two hours before performing the test.
15. How long will the line remain visible?
- The test should be read at 5 minutes for best results. A positive result will not disappear, but the lines may become darker, and a tinted background may appear after several hours. Do not read the results after 10 minutes; discard the test once you have read the result.
16. Once I see a positive result, when is the best time to have intercourse?
- Ovulation is likely to occur within 24-36 hours. This is your most fertile time. Sexual intercourse within 24-36 hours of detecting the surge is advised.
17. I am now using the basal body temperature method (BBT). Does this test replace BBT?
- Ovasure does not replace the BBT method. The BBT method indicates that ovulation has already occurred, while Ovasure indicates that ovulation is about to occur.
18. I received a positive result and had intercourse during these fertile days, but I have not become pregnant. What should I do?
- Many factors can affect your ability to become pregnant. It can take healthy couples many months to achieve pregnancy. If you do not achieve pregnancy after 3-4 months of using the test kit, consult your physician.
19. I had a positive result and had intercourse during these fertile days. I think I may be pregnant. How soon can I find out?
- You can use a Novasure pregnancy test  kits to find out if you are pregnant as early as the first day of your missed period.
20. What should I do if the test results remain negative after several attempts?
- You may have miscalculated your period. Repeat the test, and if you still get negative results, consult your doctor.
21. What if the LH surge is not detected?
- If you cannot detect an LH surge, it may be because you did not ovulate that month, which is normal occasionally. You might have missed the surge due to an irregular cycle or miscalculation. Continue testing with another kit or start testing earlier next month. Ensure that the urine sample was collected correctly, and if irregular results persist, consult your physician.
22. Can I use Ovasure while taking Sangini injections or birth control pills?
- Ovasure will not be useful if you are taking Sangini injections, as it prevents the ovulationÂ process, knowing the LH surge won't be helpful. Similarly, if you are taking birth control pills, Ovasure will not be effective as these pills affect female hormones and affect the ovulationÂ period.
23. How long should we wait to use Ovasure kits after stopping Sangini injection?
- You should wait at least 3 months after your last Sangini injection before using Ovasure kits.
24. How long should I wait to use Ovasure after stopping birth control pills?
- You can start using Ovasure after two weeks of stopping birth control pills,Â as the ovulation period usually occurs after two weeks of stopping the pills. However, it may take 1 to 2 months for some women.
