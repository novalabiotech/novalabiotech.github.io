Dengue NS1 Antigen Rapid Test is a cutting-edge chromatographic immunoassay designed for the qualitative detection of the Dengue virus NS1 antigen in blood serum or plasma. NS1 kits are the only confirmatory rapid test kits available so far . Such rapid test kits make this diagnostic tool an invaluable asset in the fight against Dengue.

Principle:

Dengue viruses, transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, pose a significant health threat in tropical and subtropical regions. Our Dengue NS1 Antigen Rapid Test utilizes a qualitative lateral flow immunoassay. Anti-Dengue NS1 antibodies immobilized on the test membrane react with gold nanoparticle-conjugated antibodies when exposed to
blood serum. The resulting antibody-antigen complex forms a colored line at the test line region, indicating a positive result. The intensity of the line correlates with the amount of Dengue antigen present in the sample.

Purpose:

 The primary purpose of this test is to validate Dengue Antigen Rapid Test Kits using human blood samples. This process is vital for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our diagnostic tool, empowering healthcare professionals to make informed
decisions.

Reagents and Materials Supplied:

Each pouch contains a test device, a disposable dropper, and a silica gel pouch. While these essentials are provided, users must also have safety lancets/syringes, alcohol swabs, disposable pipettes, a clock or timer, specimen collection containers, a centrifuge, and a biohazard waste container on hand at laboratory setup.

Procedure:

The step-by-step procedure outlines specimen collection and preparation, emphasizing the importance of prompt testing and proper storage conditions. The assay procedure details the equilibration of test components, specimen application, and result interpretation within a specified timeframe.

Result Interpretation:

Clear guidelines are provided for result interpretation, with two pink lines indicating a positive result, one pink line at (C)
indicating a negative result, and no pink line denoting an invalid result. The interpretation guide emphasizes the significance of positive and negative results, guiding further testing based on outcomes.

Novala’s Dengue NS1 Antigen Rapid Test Kit stands as a beacon of innovation in the battle against Dengue viral infections. Our commitment to accuracy, accessibility, and efficiency makes this diagnostic tool an indispensable resource for healthcare professionals worldwide.
