title: Brucellosis IgG/IgM Rapid Test
synopsis: >-
  Brucellosis, a bacterial infection transmitted from animals to humans, causes
  symptoms like fever, joint pain, and fatigue. Rapid tests for brucellosis
  detect specific antibodies in blood samples, providing quick diagnosis and
  facilitating timely treatment, crucial for preventing complications and spread
  of the disease. These tests offer a valuable tool for healthcare providers in
  regions where brucellosis is endemic, aiding in swift identification and
  management of cases.

Introduction: Brucellosis IgG/IgM Rapid Test is a state-of-the-art diagnostic tool designed to facilitate the rapid detection of Brucellosis infections, a bacteria infection. People can get the disease when they are in contact with infected animals or animal products contaminated with the bacteria. Animals that are most commonly infected include sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, and dogs, among others. Our  test provides healthcare professionals with valuable diagnostic information for the timely management of Brucellosis cases.

Intended Use: The Brucellosis IgG/IgM Rapid Test is intended for the qualitative detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to Brucella species in human serum, plasma, or whole blood samples. It serves as an invaluable aid in the diagnosis of Brucellosis infections.

Principle: Operating on the principle of lateral flow immunoassay, our rapid test employs specific antibodies to Brucella antigens immobilized on the test cassette. When a sample is applied, any IgG and IgM antibodies present in the sample bind to these immobilized antibodies, resulting in the formation of visible lines on the test strip.

Storage and Stability: Our Brucellosis IgG/IgM Rapid Test is designed for convenient storage at room temperature (2°C to 30°C), eliminating the need for refrigeration. Proper storage conditions ensure the stability and reliability of the test kit throughout its shelf life.

Precautions:

* Handle all test components with care to avoid contamination.
* Use the test kit within its specified expiration date.
* Ensure proper sample collection and preparation according to the provided instructions.
* Adhere to safety protocols and guidelines for handling biological specimens.
* Dispose of used test components in accordance with biohazard waste disposal regulations.

Procedure:

1. Collect a serum, plasma, or whole blood sample from the patient.
2. Apply the sample to the designated area on the test cassette.
3. Allow the test to develop for the specified time.
4. Interpret the results based on the appearance of visible lines on the test strip.

Limitations:

* The Brucellosis IgG/IgM Rapid Test is intended for in vitro diagnostic use only.
* Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings and additional diagnostic tests.
* False-positive or false-negative results may occur due to various factors, including improper sample handling or storage.
* The test may not detect Brucellosis infections during the early stages of illness or in patients with low antibody titers.
