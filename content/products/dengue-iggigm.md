**Introduction**: Our Dengue IgG/IgM Rapid Test is a diagnostic tool designed to aid in the rapid detection of Dengue virus infections. Our test provides healthcare professionals with valuable information for the timely management of Dengue cases.

**Intended Use**: The Dengue IgG/IgM Rapid Test is intended for the qualitative detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to the Dengue virus in human whole blood, serum, or plasma samples. It is an invaluable tool for aiding in the diagnosis of Dengue infections. It can be used along with Dengue NS1 antigen rapid test kits.

**Principle**: This rapid test operates on the principle of lateral flow immunoassay, where specific antibodies to Dengue virus antibodies IgG/IgM are immobilized on the test cassette. When the sample is applied, any IgG and IgM antibodies present in the sample bind to these immobilized antibodies, resulting in the formation of visible lines on the test strip.

**Storage and Stability**: Our Dengue IgG/IgM Rapid Test is designed for convenient storage at room temperature (2°C to 30°C), eliminating the need for refrigeration. Proper storage conditions ensure the stability and reliability of the test kit.

**Precautions**:

* Handle all test components with care to avoid contamination.
* Use the test kit within its specified expiration date.
* Ensure that the sample is properly collected and prepared according to the provided instructions.
* Follow all safety protocols and guidelines for handling biological specimens.
* Dispose of used test components according to biohazard waste disposal regulations.

**Procedure**:

* Collect a whole blood, serum, or plasma sample from the patient.
* Apply the sample to the designated area on the test cassette.
* Wait for 15 minutes for the results to develop.
* Interpret the results based on the appearance of visible lines on the test strip.

**Limitations**:

* The Dengue IgG/IgM Rapid Test is for in vitro diagnostic use only.
* Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings and additional diagnostic tests.
* False-positive or false-negative results may occur due to various factors, including improper sample collection, handling, or storage.
* The test may not detect Dengue infections during the early stages of illness or in patients with low antibody titers.
