**Introduction:**
The Syphilis  Rapid Test Kit is a qualitative immunoassay designed for the detection of antibodies to Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, in human serum or plasma. It provides a rapid and reliable method for the diagnosis of syphilis infection.
Intended Use: The Syphilis  Rapid Test Kit is intended for healthcare professionals and laboratory use as an aid in the diagnosis of syphilis. It is not intended for self-testing at home.

**Principle:**
The Syphilis  Rapid Test Kit is based on the principle of lateral flow immunoassay. The test utilizes specific antigens to selectively detect antibodies to Treponema pallidum in the test sample. The test cassette contains a membrane strip pre-coated with T. pallidum antigens and coloured particles conjugated with anti-human IgG antibodies. When the test sample is added, if antibodies to T. pallidum are present, they bind to the conjugate, forming a coloured line in the test region. The control line serves as a procedural control to validate the test results.

**Storage and Stability:**
The Syphilis  Rapid Test Kit should be stored at room temperature (2-30ºC).
The kit components are stable through the expiration date printed on the sealed pouch.
The test cassette must remain in the sealed pouch until use.
Do not freeze the test kit.
Do not use beyond the expiration date.

**Precautions:**
For in-vitro diagnostic use only.
Use the test kit in a well-ventilated area.
Handle all specimens and test components as if they contain infectious agents.
Follow standard precautions for the disposal of used test components.
Wear protective clothing, such as laboratory coats and disposable gloves, when handling specimens.
Read the instructions carefully before performing the test.

**Procedure:**
Allow the test cassette and specimens to equilibrate to room temperature (15-30ºC).
Open the sealed pouch and remove the test cassette.
Add the sample (serum or plasma) to the sample well on the test cassette.
Wait for the colored lines to appear in the result window within the specified time.
Interpret the results according to the instructions provided.

**Interpretation of Results:**
Non-Reactive Result: The presence of both the control line and the test line indicates a non-reactive result, indicating the absence of antibodies to T. pallidum in the sample.

Reactive Result: Only the control line appears. This indicates a reactive result, indicating the presence of antibodies to T. pallidum in the sample.
Invalid Result: If no lines appear, or if only the test line appears without the control line, the result is invalid. Repeat the test with a new kit.

**Limitations:**
The Syphilis  Rapid Test Kit is a screening test and should be confirmed by additional testing methods if the results are positive or inconsistent with clinical evidence.
False-negative or false-positive results may occur due to various factors, including improper sample collection, storage, or handling.
Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical information and other diagnostic findings.
