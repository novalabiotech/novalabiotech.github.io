**Introduction:**
The HCV Rapid Test Kit is a rapid, qualitative immunoassay designed for the detection of antibodies to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) in human serum or plasma. It provides a convenient and reliable method for the diagnosis of HCV infection.

**Intended Use:**
The HCV Rapid Test Kit is intended for healthcare professionals and laboratory use as an aid in the diagnosis of HCV infection. It is not intended for self-testing at home.

**Principle:**
The HCV Rapid Test Kit is based on the principle of lateral flow immunoassay. The test utilizes specific antigens to selectively detect antibodies to HCV in the test sample. The test cassette contains a membrane strip pre-coated with recombinant HCV antigens and coloured particles conjugated with anti-human IgG antibodies. When the test sample is added, if antibodies to HCV are present, they bind to the conjugate, forming a coloured line in the test region. The control line serves as a procedural control to validate the test results.

**Storage and Stability:**
The HCV Rapid Test Kit should be stored at room temperature (2-30ºC).
The kit components are stable through the expiration date printed on the sealed pouch.
The test cassette must remain in the sealed pouch until use.
Do not freeze the test kit.
Do not use beyond the expiration date.

**Precautions:**
For in-vitro diagnostic use only.
Use the test kit in a well-ventilated area.
Handle all specimens and test components as if they contain infectious agents.
Follow standard precautions for the disposal of used test components.
Wear protective clothing, such as laboratory coats and disposable gloves, when handling specimens.
Read the instructions carefully before performing the test.

**Procedure:**
Allow the test cassette and specimens to equilibrate to room temperature (15-30ºC).
Open the sealed pouch and remove the test cassette.
Add the sample (serum or plasma) to the sample well on the test cassette.
Wait for the coloured lines to appear in the result window within the specified time.
Interpret the results according to the instructions provided.
Interpretation of Results:
Non-Reactive Result: The presence of both the control line and the test line indicates a non-reactive result, indicating the absence of antibodies to HCV in the sample.
Reactive Result: Only the control line appears. This indicates a reactive result, indicating the presence of antibodies to HCV in the sample.
Invalid Result: If no lines appear, or if only the test line appears without the control line, the result is invalid. Repeat the test with a new kit.

**Limitations:**
The HCV Rapid Test Kit is a screening test and should be confirmed by additional testing methods if the results are positive or inconsistent with clinical evidence.
False-negative or false-positive results may occur due to various factors, including improper sample collection, storage, or handling.
Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical information and other diagnostic findings.
